    "  multiprocessing:- multiprocessing is a module that allows you to create and manage processes,\n",
    "                   which are independent units of execution that run concurrently. It provides an interface \n",
    "                   for spawning processes, passing data between them, and synchronizing their execution.\n",
    "                   \n",
    "                   \n",
    "        1. Parallel Execution: By using multiprocessing, you can leverage multiple CPU cores to execute tasks in parallel.\n",
    "           This is particularly beneficial for computationally intensive or time-consuming tasks, as it can significantly \n",
    "           reduce the overall execution time.\n",
    "           \n",
    "           \n",
    "        2. Improved Performance: When executing tasks concurrently, multiprocessing allows you to take advantage of the\n",
    "           available CPU resources more efficiently. This can lead to improved performance and increased throughput\n",
    "           or certain types of applications.  \n",
    "           \n",
    "           \n",
    "        3.Resource Isolation: Each process created with multiprocessing has its own memory space, which provides\n",
    "          isolation between processes. This means that if one process encounters an error or crashes, it won't affect \n",
    "          other processes. Additionally, memory is not shared by default, preventing unintended side effects due to\n",
    "          concurrent access to shared data.\n",
    "          \n",
    "          \n",
    "        4. Enhanced Responsiveness: By offloading intensive or time-consuming tasks to separate processes,\n",
    "           the main process can remain responsive and continue to handle other tasks or user interactions without\n",
    "           being blocked. This is particularly relevant in applications that require a high degree of interactivity\n",
    "           or real-time responsiveness.\n",
    "           \n",
    "           \n",
    "        5.Distributed Computing: Multiprocessing can be used to distribute tasks across multiple machines,\n",
    "          enabling distributed computing. This allows you to scale your application across a cluster of computers,\n",
    "          harnessing their combined computational power."
